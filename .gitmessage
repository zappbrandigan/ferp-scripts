# Commit format (Conventional Commits):
#   <type>(<scope>): <description>
#   <type>: <description>              # scope is optional
#   <type>(<scope>)!: <description>    # use ! for breaking changes
#
# The description SHOULD be in the imperative mood (command form) and
# describe the outcome of the change (script behavior), not the
# implementation steps.
#
# Good descriptions:
#   feat(script): add PDF text diff with optional unified-diff report
#   fix(script): prevent double spaces after illegal character stripping
#   build(release): add helper for per-script version bumping
#   feat(fscp)!: require host acknowledgement before destructive actions
#
# Bad descriptions:
#   feat(script): add script
#   fix(script): bug fix
#   refactor(script): refactor code
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Commit Types (choose ONE; custom types are allowed but keep consistent):
#
#   feat      | new script behavior or capability
#   fix       | bug fix in script logic, output, or safety checks
#   refactor  | internal cleanup with no behavior change
#   perf      | performance improvement in script execution
#   docs      | script docs, usage examples, or in-script comments
#   chore     | formatting, housekeeping, or maintenance
#   build     | packaging, distribution, or release tooling
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Suggested Scopes (choose the narrowest that fits):
#
# Scope selection guidance:
# - Pick the scope for the primary change.
# - If a commit touches both a script and config.json as incidental wiring,
#   use "script" and document the config change in the body.
# - Use "config" only when registry/manifest changes are the main purpose.
#
#   script        | single-script change
#   scripts       | multiple scripts changed in one commit
#   fscp          | script-side FSCP behavior or helpers
#   config        | script registry / config.json / manifest changes
#   release       | versioning, tagging, and release automation
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Body and Footers
#
# Use labeled sections with complete sentences.
# Omit sections that are not applicable.
#
# Summary:
# Expand on the subject line in 1–3 sentences describing the behavioral change.
#
# Script Behavior:
# - Scripts Affected: list module names (e.g., ferp.pdf_text_diff)
# - Inputs: prompts or variables added/removed/changed; if none, state "Unchanged."
# - Outputs: logs, results, or artifacts added/removed/changed; if none, state "Unchanged."
# - Filesystem Effects: files written, moved, or deleted; if none, state "None."
#
# FSCP Contract (if applicable):
# - Messages: message types emitted, consumed, or changed
#
# Safety:
# State whether the script performs destructive operations and the safeguards.
# If non-destructive, explicitly state: "Non-destructive."
#
# Compatibility:
# State whether the change is backwards compatible with the host.
# If NOT compatible, specify required host/version changes.
#
# Breaking Changes:
# If the change is breaking, do BOTH of the following:
#   1) add `!` after <type>(<scope>) in the subject line, and
#   2) add a footer starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:` describing the break
#      and the required migration steps.
#
# Example footer:
#   BREAKING CHANGE: The script now requires an explicit confirmation
#   message from the host before deleting files.
#
# References (skip if none):
# Use footer-style tokens when possible:
#   Refs: ABC-123
#   Closes #123
#   Relates-to: <link-or-id>
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Style Rules:
# - Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "add", "fix", "prevent").
# - Use complete sentences in the body.
# - Prioritize behavior, contracts, and side effects over implementation detail.
# - Write so the commit message can stand alone without reading the diff.
# - If you claim "Unchanged" or "None," ensure the diff supports it.
